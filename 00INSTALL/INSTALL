On State of Alaska tomdev copied /usr/local/oracle/ from tomprod
to tomdev using:

su
cd /usr/local/
$  time rsync -va --stats --progress dnratwtomprod.dnr.state.ak.us:/usr/local/oracle .

Verify count against tomprod:
ssh tomprod
su
cd /usr/local
du -h oracle
1.5G	oracle/product
1.5G	oracle
$  

$ find . | wc -l
10652

Size and counts for tomdev copy look good.


Copy from tomprod to tomtest
===========================
Found that tomtest already has a copy of /usr/local/oracle:

ssh tomtest
su
cd /usr/local/
du -h oracle/
...
1.5G	oracle/
$

cd oracle/
find . | wc -l
10559

Size and counts on tomtest good.
Granted compared to tomprod, tomtest is lacking:
  10652 tomprod - 10559 tomtest = 93 files short

Ignoring above for now.
